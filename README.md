# This project is a full-stack Coffee Shop Management System built using Python (Flask) for the backend and PostgreSQL for the relational database. It simulates real-world operations of a coffee shop by providing functionalities for order management, inventory tracking, and staff interface for both baristas and managers.

The system is designed with a focus on data integrity, performance, and usability, and is containerized using Docker to ensure portability and ease of deployment.
